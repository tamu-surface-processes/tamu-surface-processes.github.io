## Software projects

There are many projects we have either built in the research group, or heavily contributed to.

Some of these can be found at the [research group Github organization](https://github.com/tamu-surface-processes) page.

* `blueswede` is  a simple utility for working with ANUGA simulations. [Software repository](https://github.com/tamu-surface-processes/blueswede).


### *sandpiper* toolchain

Dr. Moodie is a PI of the [*sandpiper*](https://sandpiper-toolchain.org/) project, which is a framework of interoperable hardware and software tools that enable research products from different teams and approaches to integrate with one another more easily than ever before. 
You can learn more about the project as a whole here [https://sandpiper-toolchain.org/](https://sandpiper-toolchain.org/), and below are some of the project components we have contributed to most significantly.

* `sandplover` is a Python package for manipulating depositional system data cubes. [Software repository](https://github.com/sandpiper-toolchain/sandplover).


### Numerical landscape models

* `pyDeltaRCM` is a Python implementation of the DeltaRCM numerical delta model. [Software repository](https://github.com/DeltaRCM/pyDeltaRCM).
* `sun-fan-delta-model` is a Matlab implementation of a fluvial fan. [Software repository](https://github.com/alimaye/sun-fan-delta-model).
