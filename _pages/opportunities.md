## Postdoc Opportunities

**We do not have any internally-funded Postdoc Opportunities available at this time.**
{: .notice--danger}

I am open to supporting applications to a Postdoc Fellowship for external funding, for applicants who are interested in topics relevant to our group.
If you are writing a Postdoc Fellowship proposal and would like to collaborate, please reach out to <a href="mailto:amoodie@tamu.edu">Andrew Moodie</a> by email that includes the following items:
* a brief description of your background and expertise
* a brief description of what you would like to pursue with the postdoc proposal
* a brief description of your longer-term career goals



## Graduate Student Opportunities

**We are recruiting up to two (2) graduate students to begin in Spring 2026 and/or Fall 2026.** 
{: .notice--success}

We are now recruiting for two fully-funded PhD positions in the Texas A&M Surface Processes Group.
Positions are available to start Spring 2026 or Fall 2026, at the latest.

(1) One position is for a student who will be part of a collaborative team seeking to integrate human delta landscape management decisions into morphodynamic models over century timescales. In addition to leading model implementation and pursuing their own research questions, the student will engage in collaborative model building with planners and community leaders in coastal Louisiana. This project is an NSF-funded collaboration between Texas A&M, UT Austin, and Northeastern University.

(2) One position is for a  student who will be part of a collaborative project building open-source hardware and software for geomorphology. The student will conduct field work and numerical modeling to address questions about the future of the Salton Sea, CA.  Specific research projects can depend on the student's interest, and the student is expected to contribute to the development of open-source Python software. This project is an NSF-funded collaboration between Texas A&M, UC Riverside, CU Boulder, and UMN.

Graduate students interested in process geomorphology and relevant topics are encouraged to apply for admission to the graduate program.
The Texas A&M Department of Geography has expertise across all disciplines of Geography; please consider which faculty's research interests most closely align with your own before applying.

If you believe your research interests are closely aligned with our ongoing research topics, please reach out to <a href="mailto:amoodie@tamu.edu">Andrew Moodie</a> by email that includes the following items:
* a brief description of your background and expertise
* a brief description of what research you would like to pursue in graduate school
* an explanation of how your interests align with the group's ongoing projects



## Undergraduate Student Opportunities

**We are recruiting 1 undergraduate researcher to join the group beginning at any time.**
{: .notice--success}

We typically have 1--3 undergraduates doing research in the group. 
Undergraduate students will be mentored by PI Moodie and/or a graduate student in the group, depending on the student interest and available projects.
Please note that we typically only bring on undergraduate students that have already taken *GEOG 331: Geomorphology*, or another relevant class with PI Moodie.

Undergraduates interested in research with our group should reach out to <a href="mailto:amoodie@tamu.edu">Andrew Moodie</a>.
