### Project overview

Rivers and their floodplains are highly dynamic systems that provide many valuable ecosystem services and diverse habitats. 
Fluvial geomorphology is the study of landform development and evolution in riverine environments. 
Frequent disturbance in these environments, from hydrologic events or other forces, forms heterogeneous topography within the river corridor, influencing the dispersal of water and nutrients throughout the river-floodplain system and contributing to the development of diverse ecosystems.   

Understanding the geomorphic processes at work within a riverscape provides insight into the mechanisms that drive landscape change, providing deeper comprehension about some of the most valuable ecosystems on the planet and is useful for informing restoration efforts in fluvial environments. 

Currently, research related to fluvial geomorphology focuses on modeling and quantifying surface water connectivity in river and delta environments. 
These efforts utilize a combination of numerical modeling and field observations to study the processes driving landform change.
