  Natural delta land building processes are not fully understood. Predicting the dynamics of these landscapes supports societal sustainability on deltas.

The Mississippi River Delta has experienced significant landloss due to anthropogenic activities, such as subsurface fluid withdrawl and flood control structures, Over the past decades. Coupling with climatic warming, the continued loss of land will only accelerate. To counteract landloss, the common practive is usually through dredging and restore barrier islands. However, those solutions are costly and can only resolve the issue in the short term. Diverting sediment-rich water from main channels to nourish inactive land can provide with a more sustainable solution to fight against landloss, but there are many uncertainties regarding such nature-based solution. Motivated by Mid Barataria Sediment Diversion, one of the largest to-be ecosystem restoration projects in the world, we are trying to numerically explore delta land building processes under the impact of shallow sediment compaction.
