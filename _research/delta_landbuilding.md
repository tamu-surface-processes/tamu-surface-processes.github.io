  Natural delta land building processes are not fully understood. Predicting the dynamics of these landscapes supports societal sustainability on deltas.

River Deltas are predominantly coastal landforms that extend outward into the ocean. 
Over the past decades, they have experienced significant land loss due to anthropogenic activities such as subsurface fluid withdrawl and flood control structures. 
Coupled with climate warming, reduced sediment supply, and land subsidence, the rate of land loss is expected to accelerate in the future. 
To counteract the ongoing degradation of wetlands, sediment diversions–engineered channels designed to transport sediment-rich water to nourish inactive wetland–have gained popularity. 
This nature-based solution aims to replicate natural delt-building processes; however, significant uncertainties remain due to gaps in our understanding of lanb-building mechanisms. 
Under this theme, our research seeks to use process-based dynamics to unravel the fundamental mechanisms governing delta land-building processes. 
The knowledge learned from these research will provide us with insights for assessing wetland formation and long-term land sustainability.
